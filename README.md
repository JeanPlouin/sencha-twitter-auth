A sencha touch 2 application demonstrating how to integrate with basic Twitter auth.

Just a quick and dirty proof of concept to show how to authenticate through Twitter.
If you decide to build on this and put it into production, please change the Twitter consumer key  in the script tag including the Twitter library (<a href="https://github.com/gregfroese/sencha-twitter-auth/blob/master/sencha/index.html#L69">here</a>)
